cmjs-shell
==========

A command shell based on [CodeMirror][1].  This is perhaps more
properly called a console, but that would be confusing in javascript.

What it does
------------

Provides an input line and external methods for writing output text.  
Provides a facility for command completion and shell history.


What it does not do
-------------------

Actually process commands or provide command completions.

Demo
----

The shell was built for [electron][2], but it works in modern browsers.
